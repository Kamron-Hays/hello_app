# hello_app

This is my first Rails app, which replaces the default rails page with the text "Hello, world!"

Two basic changes were required to the default Rails project files:

  * I added a "hello" action (method) to app/controllers/application_controller.rb
  * I added a root route to config/routes.rb.
